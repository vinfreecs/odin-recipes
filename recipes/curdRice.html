    <p>Curd Rice, Dahi Chawal, Thayir Sadam, Bagala Bath, Daddojanam etc. – this is a quintessential healthy dish which the South Indians swear by. And why shouldn’t they? Nothing comes close to being as easy, filling and delicious as the Curd Rice recipe, to fight the hot climate of South India. I’d say not just down south, Curd Rice has gained popularity in other parts of India as well over the years. Curd mixed with cooked rice and herbs,
         then tempered with spices – a simple and easy recipe.</p>
