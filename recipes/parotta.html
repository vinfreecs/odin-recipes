    <p>Parotta is a layered flatbread popular in Tamilnadu and Kerala, traditionally made using maida (all-purpose flour). Working with maida and bringing out all the layers while keeping it soft is a tricky process. It involves a lot of elbow grease and 
        the husband happily indulged me by taking over the whole recipe.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>all purpose flour</li>
